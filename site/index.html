			With cloud computing, if you’ve got an internet connection you can be at work. And with most serious cloud services offering mobile apps, you’re not restricted by which device you’ve got to hand.
			I am also willing to do this course because Cloud-based services are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. If your needs increase it’s easy to scale up your cloud capacity, drawing on the service’s remote servers

			Comment
			i appreciate that you people are offering such type of financial aid program because who they cannot pay for their studies can also  take advantage. But sometime in some situation students are not able to pay dues.
